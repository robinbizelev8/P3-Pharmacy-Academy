# P³ Pharmacy Academy - Project Story

## Inspiration

The genesis of P³ Pharmacy Academy came from two deeply personal experiences that revealed critical gaps in pharmacy education and training.

**Jevin's Story: The Overwhelmed Pre-registered Pharmacist**

Jevin's inspiration struck during his own challenging journey as a pre-registered pharmacist in Singapore. Fresh from academic studies, he found himself thrust into the demanding reality of clinical practice, desperately needing guidance and mentorship. However, his preceptors—experienced pharmacists who should have been his guides—were completely overwhelmed with their day-to-day dispensing operations, patient consultations, and administrative responsibilities.

"I remember feeling lost and anxious," Jevin reflects. "The textbook knowledge I had wasn't enough when facing real patients with complex medication needs. I needed someone to coach me through clinical decision-making, but my mentors barely had time to eat lunch, let alone provide the detailed guidance I craved."

This personal struggle opened Jevin's eyes to a systemic problem: talented pharmacy graduates entering the workforce without adequate support, leading to stress, burnout, and potentially compromised patient care.

**Esleen's Story: Witnessing the Training Gap**

Esleen's inspiration came from her professional experience in sales enablement roles, where she witnessed firsthand how training gaps could cripple even the most talented professionals. But it was her conversations with potential customers—pharmacy supervisors, education coordinators, and healthcare administrators—that truly crystallized the problem.

"Every conversation revealed the same pattern," Esleen explains. "Bright, capable pharmacy graduates would start their pre-registration training with enthusiasm, only to become overwhelmed and stressed within weeks. The traditional training methods weren't working."

## What It Does

P³ Pharmacy Academy addresses these challenges through an innovative three-stage learning framework that bridges the gap between academic theory and clinical practice:

**Prepare**: Evidence-based learning modules sourced from verified Singapore healthcare authorities (MOH, HSA, PSA), ensuring medical accuracy and local relevance.

**Practice**: AI-powered clinical simulations that provide safe environments for experimentation, featuring dynamic scenario generation across 7 core therapeutic areas with real-time coaching.

**Perform**: Comprehensive competency assessments that evaluate practical application of knowledge gained from the previous modules, aligned with Singapore's pharmacy standards.

The platform's AI coaching system provides structured feedback in three sections: immediate feedback on decisions, model answers for best practices, and learning tips for continuous improvement—mimicking the supportive mentorship that busy preceptors struggle to provide.

## The Bigger Picture

P³ Pharmacy Academy represents more than just an educational platform—it's a response to the human cost of inadequate professional support. By addressing the training gaps that Jevin experienced and the systemic issues Esleen identified, we're working to ensure that every pharmacy graduate in Singapore enters their career feeling confident, competent, and supported.

Our vision extends beyond individual success to transforming pharmacy education culture: from sink-or-swim mentality to systematic, compassionate development that produces not just skilled pharmacists, but fulfilled healthcare professionals who can provide the best possible patient care.

In Esleen's words: "The P³ Framework was born out of frustration with how people are taught and trained. Too often, learning is either all theory where we prepare endlessly but never get to try, or all simulation where we practice in a vacuum without real-world pressure. What's missing is a bridge that connects knowledge, safe experimentation, and confident performance."

P³ Pharmacy Academy is that bridge.
