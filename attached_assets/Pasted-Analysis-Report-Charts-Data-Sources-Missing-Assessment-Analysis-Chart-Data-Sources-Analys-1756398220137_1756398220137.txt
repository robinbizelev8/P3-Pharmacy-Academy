Analysis Report: Charts Data Sources & Missing Assessment Analysis

     Chart Data Sources Analysis:

     1. Radar Chart (Competency Progress):
     - Location: /client/src/pages/perform.tsx lines 776-807 & 1501-1532
     - Data Source: Currently using DEMO DATA from getDemoCompetencyProgress() 
     - Values: Hard-coded scores (PA1: 52, PA2: 38, PA3: 61, PA4: 43)
     - Backend API: /api/perform/competency-progress (DISABLED - line 190: enabled: false)
     - Real Implementation: storage.getCompetencyProgressAnalytics() exists but not connected

     2. Second Chart (Performance Dashboard):
     - Data Source: Demo data from getDemoDashboardData() 
     - Backend API: /api/perform/dashboard calls storage.getPerformanceAnalyticsDashboard()
     - Values: Combines competency data with performance metrics, but also using demo data

     Critical Issues Found:

     1. Charts Using Demo Data:
     - Both charts show static demo values, not real user data
     - Backend APIs exist but frontend queries are disabled
     - No connection between completed assessments and chart values

     2. Missing Assessment Analysis System:
     - "View Report" Button: Exists but has NO FUNCTIONALITY (line 1735-1738)
     - No Assessment Marking: No system to analyze answers and provide marks
     - No Detailed Feedback: Missing individual question analysis
     - No Score Breakdown: No detailed scoring per question/scenario

     Implementation Plan:

     Phase 1: Enable Real Chart Data
     1. Enable backend API calls in perform.tsx (remove enabled: false)
     2. Fix data flow from completed assessments to analytics
     3. Replace demo data with real competency calculations

     Phase 2: Implement Assessment Analysis System
     1. Create assessment report/results page component
     2. Add detailed scoring breakdown per question
     3. Implement AI-powered answer analysis and feedback
     4. Add question-by-question marking system
     5. Connect "View Report" button to results page

     Phase 3: Enhanced Assessment Features
     1. Add answer comparison (student vs. model answer)
     2. Implement competency area scoring 
     3. Add improvement recommendations based on wrong answers
     4. Create exportable assessment reports

     Key Missing Components:
     - Assessment results storage and retrieval
     - Individual question analysis and marking
     - Detailed feedback generation for trainee answers
     - Connection between assessment completion and performance charts
