SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES:
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for diabetes management in Singapore
- Target HbA1c: <7% for most adults, individualized targets for elderly
- Blood pressure target: <130/80 mmHg for most diabetic patients

PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT:
First-line: Metformin (unless contraindicated)
- Start 500mg BD, titrate to 1000mg BD based on tolerance
- Contraindications: eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m²

Second-line options (when HbA1c >7% after 3 months):
- SGLT2 inhibitors (preferred if CVD/HF risk)
- DPP-4 inhibitors 
- Sulfonylureas
- GLP-1 receptor agonists (if obesity present)

INSULIN THERAPY:
- Initiate when HbA1c >9% despite dual therapy
- Basal insulin: Start 10 units or 0.1-0.2 units/kg
- Target fasting glucose: 4-7 mmol/L

MONITORING:
- HbA1c every 3-6 months
- Annual: Eye screening, foot examination, kidney function
- Blood pressure monitoring every visit

SINGAPORE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- High prevalence in Asian populations
- Consider genetic factors affecting drug metabolism
- Cultural dietary patterns in management`,

        content: `HSA SAFETY ALERT - March 2024

DRUG: Modafinil and Armodafinil
SAFETY CONCERN: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs)

BACKGROUND:
Health Sciences Authority has received reports of serious skin reactions including:
- Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)
- Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)
- Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

CASES REPORTED:
- 8 cases since January 2023
- Median onset: 2-8 weeks after initiation
- 2 cases required ICU admission

RISK FACTORS:
- Asian ethnicity (higher risk)
- HLA-B*1502 allele (genetic predisposition)
- Concomitant use with valproic acid

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS:
1. Inform patients of skin reaction risks before prescribing
2. Advise patients to stop medication and seek immediate medical attention if skin rash develops
3. Consider genetic testing for HLA-B*1502 in high-risk patients
4. Use lowest effective dose for shortest duration

PATIENT COUNSELING POINTS:
- Watch for skin rash, blistering, or mouth sores
- Stop medication immediately if skin changes occur
- Seek urgent medical attention for any skin reactions
- Do not restart without specialist advice

REPORTING:
Healthcare professionals should report suspected adverse reactions to HSA via www.hsa.gov.sg/adverse-events`,

        content: `HSA DRUG INTERACTION ALERT - February 2024

DRUGS INVOLVED: Warfarin and commonly prescribed antibiotics

INTERACTION MECHANISM:
- Inhibition of vitamin K synthesis by gut bacteria
- CYP2C9 enzyme inhibition (certain antibiotics)
- Protein binding displacement

HIGH-RISK ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATIONS:
1. Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)
2. Macrolides (clarithromycin, erythromycin)
3. Sulfonamides (co-trimoxazole)
4. Metronidazole

CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES:
- Increased bleeding risk
- Elevated INR values
- Potential hemorrhagic events

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Monitor INR more frequently (every 2-3 days during antibiotic course)
2. Consider dose reduction of warfarin (typically 10-25%)
3. Extend monitoring for 1 week after antibiotic completion
4. Patient education on bleeding signs

ALTERNATIVE ANTIBIOTICS (Lower interaction risk):
- Penicillins (amoxicillin, flucloxacillin)
- Cephalosporins (cephalexin)
- Azithromycin (single dose)

SINGAPORE CASE DATA:
- 15 cases of major bleeding reported (2023)
