## PROBLEM: THE BURNOUT CRISIS THREATENING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY (1 minute)

### The Burnout Epidemic
Singapore's healthcare system faces a **workforce sustainability crisis**:

- **52% of pharmacy technicians** report burnout in Singapore¹
- **25% of pharmacists** report high burnout levels (Singapore study)²
- **8.6-17% turnover rate** among pharmacists globally (systematic review)³
- **Supervisor fatigue**: 80% of healthcare workers meet burnout thresholds⁴
- **Patient safety impact**: Stressed pharmacists are **2x more likely** to make medication errors⁵
- **System inefficiency**: Poorly prepared graduates delay patient care

### Healthcare Delivery Impact
- **Manual training burden**: Supervisors spend 15+ hours/week on repetitive tasks
- **Training anxiety**: Limited safe practice opportunities increase stress
- **Documentation overload**: Complex requirements worsen administrative burnout
- **24/7 care gaps**: Supervisor unavailability leaves trainees unsupported
- **Quality compromise**: Burnout directly threatens patient care standards

### Market Urgency
- Healthcare worker turnover costs up to **200% of annual salary** per specialized professional⁶
- **47% of Singapore workers** experience work-related mental/physical exhaustion⁷
- **Healthcare inflation at 2.24%** vs 2.12% general inflation (2004-2024)⁸
- Government health expenditure **quadrupled from $3.7B to $15.2B** (2009-2020)⁹
- **Competition theme alignment**: Innovation must address both care quality AND burnout
